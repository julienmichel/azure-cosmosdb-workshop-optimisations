# azure-cosmosdb-workshop-optimisations
You will see a typical customer path that begins with building a traditional monolithic web application that uses a relational data store, to re-platforming and re-architecting their solution to a modern, cloud-native, microservices-focused solution.  
The labs will guide you in the migration path from a relational data store to a NoSQL data store that is highly scalable and ready for global distribution, serves as a solid foundation for application modernization efforts that would normally occur in parallel. 

There are a set of labs focused on optimizing the NoSQL database design to maximize performance and minimize cost. These exercises are important tools to help attendees dig deep into these concepts and learn through experimentation and research. One of the primary complaints users have when using NoSQL databases is cost. This is oftentimes due to implementers incorrectly optimizing and right-sizing the database, leading to lackluster performance or out of control spend.

These labs help attendees think beyond typical CRUD operations they may be used to for their databases and applications, and consider how they can handle the rising velocity, variety, and volume of data in today's Big Data landscape.
